    <h2>Cocktail Description</h2>
    <p>
        The Manhattan is a cocktail that in the minds of many conjures
        images of the New York City borough that is it's namesake.
        The association with the location gives the cocktail a percieved
        air of sophistication and wealth, after all it is named after the home
        of Wall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Manhattan is a simple cocktail of three ingredients, bourbon,
        sweet vermouth, and traditionally Angostra Bitters.  Often the drink
        will be served with a cherry, and some prefer to substitute rye for 
        the bourbon. A popular version of this recipe can be remembered easily
        as the amounts of each ingredient correspond to the Manhattan area code, 212.
