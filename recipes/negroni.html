    <h2>Cocktail Description</h2>
    <p>The negroni is a classic cocktail loved by many and hated by others. 
        The drink displays a delicate balance between the bitterness of the 
        gin and Campari, and the sweetness of the Campari and vermouth.
        The Campari containing both of the primary flavors of the cocktail 
        serves to bridge the gap between the gin and vermouth, locking the
        flavors together into one cohesive experience.
    </p>
    <p>There are many different variations on the negroni, but at it's most
        basic and pure it is a simple equal parts recipe of three ingredients.
        a notable variation is the boulevardier, which swaps the primary spirit
        to either bourbon or rye depending on who you're asking.
