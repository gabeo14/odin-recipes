    <h1>Old Fashioned</h1>

    <h2>Cocktail Description</h2>
    <p>
        In the latter half of the 19th century during the cocktail golden era
        some were left longing for the days before complexity and showmanship
        were the defining characteristics of the cocktail bars of the day. The most
        popular theory for now is that these nostalgic patrons would ask for 
        a drink "the old fashioned way" and that over time that just became "Old fasioned."
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary ingredients of the drink being simply whiskey and sugar
        does lend some creedence to this theory. You'll see many variations 
        on the recipe, with some using sugar cubes, others using simple syrup,
        and you may even see some where you muddle an orange slice.
